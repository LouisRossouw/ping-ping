# Ping Ping

lightweight monitoring and data-logging service built for my side projects, It performs scheduled health checks or pulls data from any provided endpoints, provides failure alerts via telegram bot. It also has a built-in REST API.

Setup:

```
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

Or

Docker:

`docker compose up -d --build`

## Configs

json configs are used to define the service, the http urls and it's endpoints to ping, and the scheduled / intervals. (the schedules & ping-apps slug & actions keys must match)

/confgs:

```
{
      "name": "Ping Ping",
      "slug": "ping-ping",
      "host": "[IP_ADDRESS]",
      "port": 5005,
      "timeout": 15,
      "log_file": "service.log", // log file
      "notifications": true, // enable notifications
      "notify_bot": "null-face", // for telegram api service
      "tele_jam_api_baseurl": "http://[IP_ADDRESS]" // for telegram api service
}
```

ping-apps.json

```
[
    {
        "name": "TimeInProgress-website-client",
        "slug": "timeinprogress_client", // * Must match schedules.json action key
        "base_url": "https://www.timeinprogress.com/",
        "endpoints": ["api/health","api/stats"],
        "active": true,
        "notify": true
    },
]
```

schedules.json

    {
        "name": "timeinprogress-website-client",
        "action": "timeinprogress_client",  // * Must match ping-apps.json slug key, i should rename this to slug.
        "trigger": "interval",
        "hours": 1
    },
